## set up Python3 Environment on your laptop

You can download and install the latest Python3 from https://www.python.org/downloads/

After you have Python3 installed, it is recommended that you create a virtual environment so that you can maintain multiple python environments for different projects. See the instructions here https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html

Note that you then need to install pyserial package for your Python environment
```
pip3 install pyserial
```

By now, you should be ready to work on Lab 2.
